dRural Marketplace install (v0.1 25/07/2022)

This guide have been tested in Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 LTS

1.- Preparing server OS: Install docker and docker-compose

    Create drural user with sudo permission
	sudo adduser drural
	sudo adduser drural sudo

    Clean system removing older docker versions
	sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc


    Install latest docker and docker compose
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
	sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
	curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
	echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

    Enabling docker service

	sudo systemctl enable docker
	sudo systemctl start docker

    Increase number of os watches for node

	echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p


    Allowing drural user to use docker

	sudo usermod -a -G docker drural

From now, we recommend using drural user.

2.- Upload dRural marketplace tar file from: 
    	Uncompress file provided by IDI EIKON in /opt/: drural folder will be created
	cd /opt
    	sudo tar xvf drural.tar.xz
   	sudo chown -R drural /opt/drural

3.- Prepare data folder

	By default we have set the platform to use /data folder. You can change this later in config file.
	This folder can be a simple folder or a mounted folder. Using a mounted LVM volume can be a good idea, allowing you to make online snapshots.

	sudo mkdir /data
	sudo mkdir /data/minio
	sudo chmod 777 /data/minio


4.- Prepare data
	
	Domain addresses.
	
		Marketplace needs only one address. As an example we will use our testing address: drural-sandbox.eu
		DNS entry must point to the server you are installing. Internally server must be able to resolve his own name too, so an /etc/hosts entry can help if you need it.

	Stripe

		Create an Stripe account and generate public key, secret key and a webhook.
		For webhook use this address: https://yourdomain/plugins/channel/default-channel/saleor.payments.stripe/webhooks/

	Generate a MAPBOX token: https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/
        Create a MAPBOX style too, name it "drural". Use MAPBOX Studio: https://studio.mapbox.com/

	Prepare Email address and SMTP account for sending emails
		
		In our example we will use marketplace@drural-sandbox.eu. Any message between marketplace and users will be sent from this address. 
		We will need an STMP configuration in concordance with this address to send emails.


From now we will work in /opt/drural/infrastructure folder
	
5.- Setting data in dev.env config file

	With all the previous data we should be ready for setting up platform. At least you will need to setup:
		# Address hosting marketplace
		MK_DOMAIN=https://drural-sandbox.eu

		# Password used for several services
		COMMON_PASSWORD=drural123

		# Token for Mapbox
		MAPBOX_TOKEN=abcd123

		# email sending settings, user and password should be url encoded if needed
		MK_DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=marketplace@drural-sandbox.eu
		MK_EMAIL_URL=smtp://user:password@mysmtpserver.com:port/?tls=True

		# Servers allowed to call marketplace graphql
		ALLOWED_CLIENT_HOSTS="drural-sandbox.eu"

		# Set your stripe tokens
		STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_51Jw7gxKlx32ZeVNH5M2Ce1pxtLLnu9yIqhbP2Q9fyFwgcu
		STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51Jw7gxKlx32ZeVNHDkQLgZvSbQy4TRBixluaTU5PxgloFa
		# Configure a webhook (waiting for url from Emergya)
		STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ID=we_1JwXNVKlx32ZeVNHBZ09mtNE
		STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY=whsec_gTWXaviE4IwGW2lssM
        
        You can make a general domain replacement with sed:
            sed -i 's/drural-sandbox.eu/yourdomain.eu/g' dev.env

6.- Set your domain name in docker-compose.yml
	Docker compose needs it for Traefik. Traefik it's a reverse proxy used to distribute requests across containers and manage https trafic and certificates.

        Again you can replace your domain with sed:
            sed -i 's/drural-sandbox.eu/yourdomain.eu/g' dev.env

        Traefik will generate certificates with Let's Encrypt. Put your email address for notifications:
            - --certificatesresolvers.le.acme.email=your@email.com

7.- Initialization tasks
	
	Login as drural user for this tasks

	Compile containers and code. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AFTER CHANGES IN dev.env!!!!

            cd /opt/drural/infrastructure
            ./build.sh
        
            Don't worry if you get some  Javascript heap out of memory errors, are from type definitions check, not for the final build.
            Build will take some time.
             
                

	Initialize platform

            ./drural up -d

            On first run marketplace needs to create data structures. Check it with "./drural logs -f | grep "apisetup" until you see "apisetup.drural exited with code 0". You can exit log with Control + C

	Once initialized we need to create some sample data and users
	
            ./createsampledata.sh

	Once all tasks are completed check with login in: https://yourdomain.com/dashboard/
        First access could take some minutes, node needs to webpack application.
		User: admin@example.com
		Password: admin


8.- Starting and stopping

	From /opt/drural/infrastructure folder run

        If you changed any environment variables
	Starting:	./drural.sh up -d
	Stopping:	./drural.sh down

        If there is no changes could be faster
	Starting:	./drural.sh start
	Stopping:	./drural.sh stop


	For logs:	./drural-sh logs -f | grep "component name"
	You can get component names if you run a "docker stats" when running.
	

9.- Checking logs

	docker compose logs | grep container_name

10.- Setting up automatic start

	COMING SOON

11.- Backups

	COMING SOON

12.- Things that will be improved
	- Compilable docker images for dashboard and storefront for less CPU and RAM usage
        - Chatwoot integration
