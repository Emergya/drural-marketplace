dRural Marketplace install (v0.2 03/05/2023)

This guide have been tested in Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 LTS. Is highly recommended to use LVM and have some free space for snapshots.

1.- Preparing server OS: Install docker and docker-compose

    Create drural user with sudo permission
	sudo adduser drural
	sudo adduser drural sudo

    Clean system removing older docker versions
	sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc


    Install latest docker and docker compose
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
	sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
	curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
	echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

    Enabling docker service

	sudo systemctl enable docker
	sudo systemctl start docker

    Increase number of os watches for node

	echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p


    Allowing drural user to use docker

	sudo usermod -a -G docker drural

From now, we recommend using drural user.

2.- Upload dRural marketplace tar file from: 
    	Uncompress file provided by IDI EIKON in /opt/: drural folder will be created
	cd /opt
    	sudo tar xvf drural.tar.xz
   	sudo chown -R drural /opt/drural

3.- Prepare data folder

	By default we have set the platform to use /data folder. You can change this later in config file.
	This folder can be a simple folder or a mounted folder. Using a mounted LVM volume can be a good idea, allowing you to make online snapshots.

	sudo mkdir /data
	sudo mkdir /data/minio
	sudo chmod 777 /data/minio


4.- Prepare data
	
	Domain addresses.
	
		Marketplace needs two addresses, one for marketplace and another one for dashboard. As an example we will use our testing address: 
			- drural-sandbox.eu for marketplace
			- dashboard.drural-sandbox.eu for dashboard
		DNS entry must point to the server you are installing. Internally server must be able to resolve his own name too, so an /etc/hosts entry can help if you need it.

	Stripe

		Create an Stripe account and generate public key, secret key and a webhook.
		For webhook use this address: https://drural-sandbox.eu/plugins/channel/default-channel/saleor.payments.stripe/webhooks/
		Remember to customize for your address.

	Generate a MAPBOX token: https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/
        Create 2 MAPBOX styles in studio. Use MAPBOX Studio: https://studio.mapbox.com/
        	- dRural_mapBox_style_dash. Will be used for mapbox in dashboard.
        	- dRural_mapBox_style_front. Will be used for mapbox in marketplace.
       	You can tune these styles to adapt Mapbox for your site. Once created share it and copy your mapbox:// url.

	Prepare Email address and SMTP account for sending emails
		
		In our example we will use marketplace@drural-sandbox.eu. Any message between marketplace and users will be sent from this address. 
		We will need an STMP configuration in concordance with this address to send emails.


From now we will work in /opt/drural/infrastructure folder
	
5.- Setting data in .env config file

	With all the previous data we should be ready for setting up platform. At least you will need to setup:
		# Address hosting marketplace
		MK_DOMAIN=https://drural-sandbox.eu

		# Password used for several services
		COMMON_PASSWORD=drural123

		# Token for Mapbox
		MAPBOX_TOKEN=abcd123
		# Style for dashboard
		MAPBOX_STYLES_URL=mapbox://styles/vicsanca/cl74kzmgf003714nyxa9y18jj
		# Style for marketplace
   		NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_STYLES_URL=mapbox://styles/vicsanca/cl74kzgnr000514ptfrj78kk

		# email sending settings, user and password should be url encoded if needed
		MK_DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=marketplace@drural-sandbox.eu
		MK_EMAIL_URL=smtp://user:password@mysmtpserver.com:port/?tls=True

		# Servers allowed to call marketplace graphql
		ALLOWED_CLIENT_HOSTS="drural-sandbox.eu"

		# Set your stripe tokens
		STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_51Jw7gxKlx32ZeVNH5M2Ce1pxtLLnu9yIqhbP2Q9fyFwgcu
		STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51Jw7gxKlx32ZeVNHDkQLgZvSbQy4TRBixluaTU5PxgloFa
		# Configure a webhook (waiting for url from Emergya)
		STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ID=we_1JwXNVKlx32ZeVNHBZ09mtNE
		STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY=whsec_gTWXaviE4IwGW2lssM
        
        You can make a general domain replacement with sed:
            sed -i 's/drural-sandbox.eu/yourdomain.eu/g' .env

6.- Set your domain name in docker-compose.yml
	Docker compose needs it for Traefik. Traefik it's a reverse proxy used to distribute requests across containers and manage https trafic and certificates.

        Again you can replace your domain with sed:
            sed -i 's/drural-sandbox.eu/yourdomain.eu/g' .env

        Traefik will generate certificates with Let's Encrypt. Put your email address for notifications:
            - --certificatesresolvers.le.acme.email=your@email.com

7.- Initialization tasks
	
	Login as drural user for this tasks

	Compile containers and code. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AFTER CHANGES IN .env!!!!

            cd /opt/drural/infrastructure
            ./build.sh
        
            Don't worry if you get some  Javascript heap out of memory errors, are from type definitions check, not for the final build.
            Build will take some time.

	Initialize platform

            ./drural up -d

            On first run marketplace needs to create data structures. Check it with "./drural logs -f | grep "apisetup" until you see "apisetup.drural exited with code 0". You can exit log with Control + C

	Once initialized we need to create some sample data and users
	
            ./createsampledata.sh

	Once all tasks are completed check with login in: https://yourdomain.com/dashboard/
        First access could take some minutes, node needs to webpack application.
		User: admin@example.com
		Password: admin


8.- Starting and stopping

	From /opt/drural/infrastructure folder run

    If you changed any environment variables you will need to rebuild docker images.
    	Stopping:	./drural.sh down
    	Rebuild:    ./build.sh
		Starting:	./drural.sh up -d
		
    If there is no changes could be faster
    	Stopping:	./drural.sh stop
		Starting:	./drural.sh up -d	

9.- Checking logs

	You can get component names if you run a "docker stats" when running.
		./drural-sh logs logs | grep container_name

10.- Setting up automatic start

	COMING SOON

11.- Backups

		Data is stored in /data
		To make a safe backup there is two ways:
			1.- Stop drural and make a tar of /data folder
			2.- Use LVM to make a filesystem snapshot and tar /data folder. Once tar is finished you can delete snapshot.

Any question please contact drural@idieikon.com
